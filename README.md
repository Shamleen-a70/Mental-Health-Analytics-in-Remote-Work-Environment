Mental Health Analytics in Remote Work Environments is a comprehensive data analysis project that explores how different work arrangements—remote, hybrid, and onsite—impact employees’ mental well-being. Leveraging Python for data cleaning and preprocessing, R for statistical analysis, and Tableau for interactive visualization, the project examines trends in stress levels, job satisfaction, working hours, and common mental health conditions across various demographics and job roles. The insights generated aim to support organizations in creating data-driven strategies to enhance employee well-being, mitigate burnout, and foster a healthier, more productive workforce in the evolving world of work.

## Objectives

- Analyze how different work arrangements (remote, hybrid, onsite) affect employees’ mental health.
- Compare stress levels, job satisfaction, and mental health conditions across age groups and job roles.
- Explore the relationship between weekly work hours and stress levels.
- Identify patterns that can guide organizational policies for employee well-being.
- Create a clear, interactive Tableau dashboard for decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.express)
- R (ANOVA, t-tests, chi-square,f-tests,z-test)
- Tableau (interactive dashboard)
- GitHub for version control

## Dataset

This project uses the Remote Work & Mental Health dataset from Kaggle, containing survey responses from around 5,000 people across different industries, roles, and age groups.

- Key details in the dataset:
- Work arrangements: Remote, Hybrid, Onsite
- Stress levels and mental health conditions (Anxiety, Burnout, Depression, etc.)
- Job satisfaction and work-life balance ratings
- Demographics: Age group, gender, job role, weekly work hours
The dataset is used for data cleaning and EDA in Python, statistical analysis in R, and dashboard creation in Tableau.
